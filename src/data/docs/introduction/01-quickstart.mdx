Get up and running with Haloy in minutes. This guide will walk you through deploying your first application.

## Prerequisites

- **Server**: Any modern Linux server
- **Local**: Docker for building your app
- **Domain**: A domain or subdomain pointing to your server for secure API access

## 1. Install haloy

<InstallHaloy />

## 2. Server Setup

Use the `server setup` command to provision your server automatically. This command will SSH into your server as `root` (default), install Docker if needed, install `haloyadm`, and configure the remote `haloyd` service.

<Code code="haloy server setup <server-ip> --api-domain haloy.yourserver.com --acme-email you@email.com" lang="bash" />

**Note:** This command requires SSH access to the `root` user on the server. If you don't have this or if you prefer to install manually, check the [Server Installation](/docs/server-installation#manual-installation) guide.

## 3. Create haloy.yaml

Create a `haloy.yaml` file:

<Code
  code={`
  name: "my-app"
  server: haloy.yourserver.com
  domains:
    - domain: "my-app.com"
      aliases:
        - "www.my-app.com" # Redirects to my-app.com
`}
  lang="yaml"
/>

This will look for a Dockerfile in the same directory as your config file, build it and upload it to the server. This is the Haloy configuration in its simplest form.

Check out the [examples repository](https://github.com/haloydev/examples) for complete configurations showing how to deploy common web apps like Next.js, TanStack Start, static sites, and more.

## 4. Deploy

<Code code={`
  haloy deploy

  # Check status
  haloy status
`} lang="bash" />

That's it! Your application is now deployed and accessible at your configured domain.
